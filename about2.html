					<p>This is the main area or column. I'm doing this as an exercise for a Udemy class I'm taking on html and css. When I learned github generously allows you to post a repository as a web site I decided to try it. </p>

					<p>
						What I'm learning about right now is page styling using CSS. That's
						Cascading Style Sheets. When I made some web sites with HTML4
						several years ago a lot of the styling was done in the same
						page that contained the verbage. This has changed with HTML5
						and it is epected this information will come from a separate
						css file. The css file contains things like alignment, color,
						fonts and other layout particulars.
					</p>

					<p>It can be a lot of trial and error at this point as a change
						to correct one problem might introduce a new unexpected problem,
						for instance too much padding might cause my page to lose
						it's two column appearance.

						5 Mar 22. As this site is hosted on github I'm trying to utilize git to sync what is on my computer with what is on github. Todays updates will be the first test. Also have the beginnings of a nav menu on the home page but you have to use the browser back funtion to get back to the home page.
					</p>
					<p>This is the sidebar. It will be kind of a info area occuping the right
						third of the screen showing the steps taken to get to the final design
						of the test site. Initial state is the index page showing a hello world
						program and a cool prompt from my mac mini I found after googling Kali
						prompt. CSS is giving us the black and green look and the copy wrong strip
						along the bottom.</p>
